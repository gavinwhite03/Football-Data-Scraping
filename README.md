# Football-Data-Scraping
Football Data Scraping Project
Overview
This project involves scraping football (soccer) data from a popular sports statistics website using Python, primarily leveraging the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. The goal is to collect comprehensive match statistics for multiple seasons of a football league, focusing on metrics related to passing, shooting, defense, and goal creation.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for scripting and data processing.
Jupyter Lab: An interactive development environment for running Python code, particularly useful for exploratory data analysis.
BeautifulSoup: A Python library for extracting data from HTML and XML files, crucial for web scraping.
Pandas: A powerful data analysis library in Python, utilized for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the scraped data.
Excel: Microsoft Excel is employed for data visualization, further analysis, and report generation.
Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

Scraping Scripts: Python scripts developed in Jupyter Lab for scraping data from the football statistics website. These scripts utilize BeautifulSoup to parse HTML and extract relevant information.
Data Processing: Once scraped, the data is processed using Pandas to clean, transform, and structure it into usable formats, such as CSV or Excel files.
Analysis and Visualization: Data analysis is performed using Pandas and Excel, enabling insights into team performance, player statistics, and other relevant metrics.
Usage
To use this project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the scraping scripts in Jupyter Lab to collect football data from the specified website.
